# OpenCL_VGG16
Using the OpenCL framework, we built a VGG16 CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)
for object recognition to run on heterogeneous environments such as CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. OpenCL
provides hardware acceleration similar to CUDA, but it can be deployed on non-Nvidia
GPUs, making it widely used for edge and fog computing.
